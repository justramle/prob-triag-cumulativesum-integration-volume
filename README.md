## Practise in R with mathematics part 1

- In the first task, 1000 uniformly distributed random values between 0 and 1 are generated using set.seed(1). The mean and variance of these values are calculated to understand their central tendency and dispersion. Additionally, a cumulative sum of these values is computed, and a plot is created to visualize this cumulative sum against the sequence numbers (1 to 1,000). A horizontal line at height 0.5 is added to the plot for reference, showing how the cumulative sum fluctuates around the expected mean of the uniform distribution. This help providing insights into the behavior of uniform random variables

- In the second task, for a continuous random variable X following a uniform(0,1) distribution, the calculation of its mean (μ) and variance (σ²) involves integration using its density function. The density function for a uniform(0,1) distribution is defined as f(x) = 1 in the interval [0, 1], and f(x) = 0 elsewhere. To find the mean, we integrate x times f(x) across the interval [0, 1], which results in a mean (μ) of 0.5. For the variance, we integrate (x - μ)^2 times f(x) over the same interval. This computation yields a variance (σ²) of 1/12 which is 0.0833. These calculations show the uniform distribution's property of having its values evenly spread across the interval [0, 1], with a central tendency at the midpoint and a small spread around this mean

- In the third task, apply Monte Carlo simulation: generate two sets of 1000000 points uniformly within the square [-1,1] x [-1,1] and stored as variables `x` and `y`. The number of points satisfying ( x^2 + y^2 < 1 ) is counted, representing a circle with radius 1. The ratio of these points to the total number gives the area of the circle when multiplied by 4 (the area of the square), approximating π. Extending this to three dimensions with a figure defined by ( x^2 + y^4 + z^6 < 1 to estimates its volume, demonstrating the Monte Carlo method's utility in approximating geometric properties in complex spaces

- In the last task, estimate the probability that three segments, formed by selecting two random points on the interval [0, 1], can create a triangle. The crucial criterion for forming a triangle is that the sum of the lengths of any two segments must be greater than the length of the third segment. To estimate this probability, the simulation runs 10,000 iterations, in each of which two uniform(0,1) values are generated. These values represent the points dividing the interval into three segments. By sorting these points and calculating the differences, we can determine the lengths of the three segments. The code counts the number of times these segments satisfy the triangle inequality (the sum of the lengths of any two segments being greater than the third). This count, divided by the total number of trials (10,000), gives an approximation of the probability that randomly chosen segments will form a triangle. The process is an example of a Monte Carlo method, a computational algorithm that relies on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results, commonly used in physical and mathematical problems.
